1. The repeatability of song production in 30 minutes from zebra finches at a constant temperature (40 C) for an initial 30 minutes. Tested every other day for 6 days (3 test days, 3 rest days).
2. The variation in song production in 30 minutes from zebra finches at 5 different temperature treatments (27, 35, 40, 42, 44) after an initial 30 minutes of exposure. Tested every other day for 10 days (5 test days, 5 rest days).
3. The variation of song production in 30 minutes from zebra finches at 5 temperature treatments (27, 35, 40, 42, 44) after 2 hours of initial exposure. Tested every other day for 10 days (5 test days, 5 rest days). Treatments occured after a six day acclimation period where males were shown a female every other day for 30 minutes with no heat exposure. (3 acclimation days, 3 rest days).
